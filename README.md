<h2>project description</h2>

In this project, I build an application combining html, css, and javascript to display a list of pokemon and pull data from an external source. 
This application is interactive, you'll find that when users click on a pokemon a display will pop up listing information on the pokemon.  I also installed some UI libraries, like bootrap, that have default rules and stylings to help make this app look more professional.
